# Language Benchmark

This is a collection of simple counting-to-1-billion benchmark programs implemented in multiple programming languages to measure their execution time and compare their performance. By running the same benchmark in different languages, we can observe how each language handles this task and which one completes it the fastest.

## Usage
```bash
./run.sh
```
